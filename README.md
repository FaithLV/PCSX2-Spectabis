# PCSX2-Spectabis

Spectabis is a free custom frontend for PlayStationÂ®2 emulator PCSX2 without tinkering for hours with settings for each game or creating complicated setups for each game. Instead, Spectabis takes it all from you hands so you enjoy what matters - your games.


#Notes

Spectabis is still in early development, and is barely working ATM.
